# FamilyGuy-cutaway-gag-generator
Simple CLI Python script that generates Family Guy cutaway-gags.
# --- #

I'm currently working on creating the same application using C# to build it with a GUI on Windows and to build a Linux GUI using either Qt or Tkinter, I'll upload the source to this repo either way.

----- Usage, and working toward an optimal solution.
Build binaries
Remove the dependencies of having users requiring Python to run the application, considering the usage of this app, it should be fairly simple with little risks of bugs, altho they might occur.
